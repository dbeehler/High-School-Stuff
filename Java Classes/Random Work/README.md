# Java Work

## This is all my random java work ranging from personal programs to random stuff I've made.<br>
## Consists of games, challenges, and random *other* stuff.
### Color Guesser: *COMPLETE*
- Done in JOptionPane. Contains randomness, array's and html. started 5/17/2016 -- ended 5/20/2016
  - You guess the color of the word, not the word it's self.
  - Example: the color is RED, and the word is BLUE. you would type RED becuase its the color
### Timer
- Asks user to tell it to count up, or down. started 5/18/2016 -- finished 5/22/2016
  - if it counts up it goes until stopped.
  - if it counts down, user specify's time.
  
#### Problems
- No way to stop loop. for counting up, besides (hours > 24)

### Hawkeye Challenges
These are my attempt's at the 2016 Hawkeye Challenges. started 5/26/2017
